## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I was able to try out a different layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.contain1 {
        transform: translateX(-18%);
    }

    .contain2 {
        min-width: 360px;
    }

    .contain3 {
        transform: translateX(18%);
    }

    .card1 {
        transform: translateY(-16%);
    }

    .card3 {
        transform: translateY(16%);
    }

```



### Continued development

I will continue to try out more layouts to further increase my skills
