```css
    .card {
        display: inline-block;
        min-width: 330px;
    }

    .card-1 {
        transform: translateY(43%);
    }

    .card-2 {
        display: block;
        transform: translateY(-145%);
    }

    .card-3 {
        display: block;
        transform: translateY(-146%);
    }

    .card-4 {
        transform: translateY(-330%);
        float: right;
    }
```
